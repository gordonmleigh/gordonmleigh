## ✅ Top 5 Reasons to Hire Me

### 1. I'm an expert in Full-Stack TypeScript (React/Node.js) development

I've focused mostly on building full-stack TypeScript applications since 2017, letting me build a decent level of expertise with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and cloud-native technologies such as AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, and API Gateway.

### 2. I'm a multi-technologist

As well as building skills in my preferred stack, I've also built software (including professionally) in Go, C++, C#, PHP, and even 6502 Assembly.

### 3. I'm a solver, not just a builder

I have never limited myself to just building what I'm told: colleagues and clients value that I take time to get to the bottom of the requirements and work with them to build the best solution. My favorite role allows me to have impact on the business/product side as well as technical.

### 4. I care about people

I love to work with teams to improve their communication and process, to boost their motivation, happiness, and ultimately productivity. Leaders who focus on productivity while neglecting team cohesiveness do not build sustainable teams. In a few roles I have been able to turn unproductive, dysfunctional teams around to delivering regularly and being happy, and this has counted among my most rewarding career experiences.

### 5. I'm not driven by ego

I strive to be _professionally irreverent_: challenge the status quo, ask why, and work to build a great solution—but always with empathy and respect for my colleagues, an open mind, and a drive to learn more. I don't do things just to look smart, and I don't avoid asking questions out of fear of looking stupid.

## 🎯 What I'm looking for

I would like to join an exciting tech startup in a high-impact IC role where I can collaborate with motivated and skilled people. I'm taking my time to find a role that I can see myself in 5 years from now.
